# Library Searcher Client Website

## The "Why"

I hold library cards to 4 different municipalities in the Greater Vancouver region (new west, richmond, burnaby, and vancouver) and often search across them all for books and its availabilty. Sometimes certain titles are available at some, or has a smaller hold queue, and so I will choose to borrow accordingly. 

This website allows searching of the 4 different libraries, and see all contents and its availability, so you can know exactly where to borrow your content. 

Fully response on web & mobile :) 

This is a simple html, css, js website built using jQUery, boostrap MDB, and mustache.js

This website is currently hosted live at: https://libsearcher.herokuapp.com/

Or if you wish to view this locally, upon cloning this repo, you can view the site simply by opening up `home.html`

You can disregard the `index.php`, that's for the sake of tricking Heroku to serve this as a php site
